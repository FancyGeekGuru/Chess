# Contributing

If you wish to contribute there are some things that need be done before coding.

This project has Eslint, Prettier and EditorConfig settings, so make sure to install the correct extensions in your favorite IDE. I chose to use the [AirBnB Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for coding, so it will be a lot easier if you have all of them installed.

## Things needed to be done

- Add unit testing
- Add history navigation through the moves of the game
- Help with translation. I'm not an native english speaker, so this project may have some typos
- You can add other things that I'm not listing here

## Pushing code

There is a `develop`, so you need to push to that branch and open a pull request. I'll will evaluate it and merge with the `master` branch.
